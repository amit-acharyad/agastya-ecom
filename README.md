# Running the Project Locally

As for the MVP we have used two of the dummy stores so installing the project locally might be some hazzle. We were really keen to use docker but due to time limitations we were unable to do it. So, to run the project locally.

``` git clone https://github.com/bhusal-rj/agastya-ecom ```

After cloning let's go inside the agastya-ecom.

Afterwards run 

```
npm run install-all

```
which lets you install all the npm packages recursively

```
```
