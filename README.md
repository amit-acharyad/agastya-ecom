# Running the Project Locally

For the MVP, we utilized two placeholder stores, intending to eventually integrate various e-commerce platforms into the complete product. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, Docker implementation was deferred. Consequently, to locally run the project, cloning is necessary. Please follow the steps below:

```

git clone https://github.com/bhusal-rj/agastya-ecom

 ```

Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the agastya-ecom directory:
 ```
cd agastya-ecom
```

Next, execute the following command to install all the npm packages recursively:
```

npm run install-all

```
This will ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed for the project.
